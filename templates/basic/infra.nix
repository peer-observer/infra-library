  # This is the definition of a peer-observer infrastructure.
  # The infrastructure consists of one or more nodes and one or more webservers.
  #
  # On nodes, the following services run:
  # - a Bitcoin node (Bitcoin Core by default)
  # - peer-observer extractors and tools
  # - a NATS server for the peer-observer extractors and tools to communicate
  # - a wireguard interface that opens connections to all webservers
  # - ...
  #
  # On webservers, the following services run:
  # - an nginx webserver (requires you to point a (sub)domain to it)
  # - a Prometheus and Grafana instance
  # - the peer-observer frontend tools (websocket, ...)
  # - a fork-observer instance connected to all nodes
  # - an addrman-observer instance connected to all nodes
  #
  # The configuration options are documented in
  # https://peer-observer.github.io/infra-library
  #
  # However, this is NixOS and you can pretty much override everything.
  # To do this, use the (global, per-host) extraConfig arguments below.
  #
  # Keep in mind that you are responsible for securing your servers yourself.
  # You might want to apply additional hardening.

  # NOTE: by default, all hosts defined here are set to `setup = true;`.
  # This enables easier and faster initial set up. Once you provisioned the
  # secrets for a node (see docs/secrets.md), feel free to set `setup = false;` and
  # redeploy the node.
